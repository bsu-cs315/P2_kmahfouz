## Project Report

### Reflection

For this iteration, Git worked fine for a change. Overall, my work ethic for this iteration was better, in that, I actually worked on it in advance and not all last minute. Unfortunately, I made the mistake of not noticing that there had to be a HUD to get a B, so, instead of adding juice for the A grade, I worked on the HUD. It's bad. I could not get the fonts to work and it's there just to be there. But, it's a HUD I suppose.

*** Juice

Unfortunately, The only 'juice' I added was the sound effects, which is the bare minimum, but I need the B.
